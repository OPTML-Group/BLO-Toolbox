# A Toolbox for Bi-level Optimization (BLO)

> Note: The toolbox is still in the development phase and we will release the first version of the toolbox as soon as possible. This repo only contains the source code to reproduce the results now. Please stay tuned and features are subject to changes.

BLO-Toolbox is an extensive toolbox designed to facilitate the exploration and development of bi-level optimization (BLO) applications in machine learning and signal processing. The repository is aligned with the tutorial paper, "An Introduction to Bi-level Optimization: Foundations and Applications in Signal Processing and Machine Learning." It contains code, tools, and examples that are built upon state-of-the-art methods.


## Introduction

Bi-level optimization (BLO) has a growing presence in the fields of machine learning and signal processing. It serves as a bridge between traditional optimization techniques and novel problem formulations. The BLO-Toolbox aims to provide researchers, developers, and enthusiasts a flexible platform to build and experiment with various BLO algorithms.
